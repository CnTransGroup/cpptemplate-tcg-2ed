[online read](https://cntransgroup.github.io/cpptemplate-tcg-2ed/)

## Preparation
I use [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to build the markdown to book. As you should install the `mdbook` and 
```
mdbook serve 
```
or 
```
mdbook build 
```

If you need output pdf or epub format file, you need install mdbook-pdf or mdbook-epub to achieve.
